# Mylly GUI C# Wrapper

This is an experimental C# wrapper for [Mylly GUI](https://github.com/teejii88/mgui) (MGUI). You can find more information about MGUI from the main repository page. This sample project wraps most of MGUI's functionality in C# classes and implements a basic test application written in C#.

The wrapper includes MGUI and its support libraries as submodules, so clone the repository recursively. You'll need the latest beta version of [premake4](http://industriousone.com/premake/download) to generate the project files. Test skin and images for the test app can be found from [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/oOgzn).
